## About the Project
This is more geared towards personal use. All it does is manage one of my discord servers and make clock-ins easier for a FIVEM server I am in. Its got forms or clock-in buttons you can use and it saves information so you don't have to keep repeating information in it. I set it up to be used by multiple users, however, I imagine it is only going to be used by me. Feel free to look at it if you want idk what anyone would do with it...
